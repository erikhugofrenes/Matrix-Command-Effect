# Matrix Command Effect
Reimagines the Matrix Command Line Effect in CMD

## Setup Instructions

Navigate to the folder holding the program:

cd 

### Running the Program

To run the program, use the following command:

java -jar MatrixCommandEffect.jar prefix command args...

### Limitations
- only supported prefix "infinite"
      - does form text just tries to display the matrix stream effect across a full screen
      - it is recommended when running this you want to have CMD open as a full screen application

- for just wanting to apply the effect on CMD commands, simply use the prefix "pre"
      - Try to execute only CMD commands that are able to easily be displayed on a CMD screen without scrolling, since larger inputs currently render   
        incorrectly
